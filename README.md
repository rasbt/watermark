## Installation and updating

[[top](#sections)]

The watermark line magic can be installed by executing

```bash
pip install watermark
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub via

```bash
pip install -e git+https://github.com/rasbt/watermark#egg=watermark
```

<br>

Note:

To remove an old `watermark` installation (installed via the deprecated `%install_ext` magic extension), simply delete it from the ``.ipython/extensions/`` directory, which is typically located in a user's home directory.


## Usage

[[top](#sections)]

After successful installation, the `watermark` magic extension can be loaded via:

	%load_ext watermark

<br>

To get an overview of all available commands, type:

	%watermark?

```
%watermark [-a AUTHOR] [-d] [-n] [-t] [-i] [-z] [-u] [-c CUSTOM_TIME]
               [-v] [-p PACKAGES] [-h] [-m] [-g] [-w]

and various system information.

## Changelog

[[top](#sections)]


#### v. 1.4.0 (April 18, 2017)

- Adds a new `-r`/ `--gitrepo` parameter that returns the URL of Git remote name "origin". (via contribution by [Lucy Park](https://github.com/e9t))

#### v. 1.3.4 (October 15, 2016)

- Allow fetching scikit-learn's version number via `-p scikit-learn` in addition of `-p sklearn` (the former is deprecated and will not be supported in watermark > 1.7)

#### v. 1.3.3 (September 1, 2016)

- Includes LICENSE in MANIFEST.in for packaging

#### v. 1.3.2 (August 16, 2016)

- Fixes an issue where the wrong package info was obtained when using the system level Jupyter within a virtualenv environment. (via contribrution by [Michael Bell](https://github.com/mrbell))
- Adds a new `-i`/ `--iso8601` parameter that returns the current date-time string in ISO 8601 format with offset to UTC. For instance: `2016-08-16T18:03:42-04:00`. Current caveat: Python < 3.2 requires external libraries for for computing the timezone offset, thus, Python < 3.2 will currently only print `2016-08-16T18:03:42`
- Adds offsets to UTC to the default date-time string for Python >= 3.2

#### v. 1.3.1 (June 6, 2016)

- Fixes an issue that caused problems importing watermark using Python 2.x

#### v. 1.3.0 (May 21, 2016)

- Removed the deprecated the %install_ext magic so that watermark can now be installed as a regular python package via `pip` (via [Peter Bull](https://github.com/pjbull))

#### v. 1.2.3 (Jan 29, 2016)
- Changed date format to the unambiguous ISO-8601 format
- Ditched the deprecated %install_ext function and made watermark a proper Python package
- Released the new version under a more permissive newBSD [license](./LICENSE)

#### v. 1.2.2 (Jun 17, 2015)
- Changed the default date-format of `-d`, `--date` to MM/DD/YYYY, the format DD/MM/YYYY can be used via the shortcut `-e`, `--eurodate`.

#### v. 1.2.1 (Mar 3, 2015)
- Small bugfix to allow custom time string formatting.

#### v. 1.2.0 (Oct 01, 2014)
- `--watermark` command added to print the current version of watermark.
